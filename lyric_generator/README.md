This is a wireframe for the app

## Wireframe

### Purpose
This app allows users to search their gifs and they pull right up! Helps better with communication!


### Third Party Api
https://genius.com/api

I'll make a searchbar component, Which holds state of what the user typed in to search, and then when they submit their search I will have another component <Results /> that takes that search as a prop and renders the gifs for the search.

I reached out for help as my api wouldn't work and i tried other lyric api's so i just decided to switch what i was doing last minute. Didn't change the name of the repo so it doesn't get messed up. Hereby causing the Main folder to be Lyric generator with Gif generator contents.
